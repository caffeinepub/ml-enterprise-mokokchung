        "On mobile and desktop, the header brand block on the left is visibly resized (larger or smaller as implemented) compared to the current `text-lg`/`text-xs` styling.",
        "The header height, navigation alignment, and mobile menu button remain vertically centered and do not overlap the resized brand block.",
        "Clicking/tapping the brand block still scrolls smoothly to `#home` and closes the mobile sheet if it is open.",
        "No user-facing text is changed (brand still reads “ML Enterprise” and “Mokokchung”)."

          "description": "Update the left-side brand button styles to use responsive font sizes (e.g., base vs sm/md), line-height, and controlled vertical gap so the brand is clearly visible without increasing header height or causing overlap. Ensure the brand button remains vertically centered within the existing `h-16` header row, and preserve the existing `scrollToSection('#home')` behavior (including closing the mobile Sheet). Since the header uses shadcn-ui Button/Sheet components, ensure the changes do not interfere with their layout/interaction; verify the component's usage instructions before implementing."
