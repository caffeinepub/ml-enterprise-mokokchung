# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a new Gallery section to the single-page site to showcase provided images with a preview experience.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a new page section with id="gallery" containing an English heading and short descriptive text.
- Render the uploaded image (image-1.jpg) as a static frontend asset in a responsive grid layout with an English alt attribute.
- Add a click-to-preview interaction (modal/lightbox) for gallery thumbnails with accessible close controls (close button and Escape key).
- Add “Gallery” to the site navigation (desktop and mobile) linking to #gallery with smooth scrolling.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can navigate to a new Gallery section from the site menu, view images in a responsive grid, and click an image to open a larger preview that can be closed via a button or the Escape key.
