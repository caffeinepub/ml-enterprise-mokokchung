One requirement about adding the static image asset itself is not evidenced in the provided diff summary.",

      "reason": "The Gallery section references '/assets/image-1.jpg', but the diff summary does not show the actual static asset file being added under frontend/public/assets (binary assets may be omitted from the LLM-readable diff, so this cannot be confirmed).",
