# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the Courier Partners section and any related navigation so it no longer appears or is referenced anywhere on the single-page site.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the Courier Partners section from the single-page layout so it does not render in the page flow.
- Remove the "Courier Partners" link from both desktop and mobile header navigation.
- Remove any remaining in-app references to the "#courier-partners" anchor to avoid broken navigation.

**User-visible outcome:** The site no longer shows a Courier Partners section, and the navigation/menu contains no Courier Partners link; scrolling/anchor navigation continues to work for the remaining sections.
